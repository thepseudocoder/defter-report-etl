# defter-report-etl
An ETL script for the spreadsheet reports generated by DEFTER app.

This script simply merges all account reports (xlsx) generated by [DEFTER](https://defter.net/) personal accounting app into one BI-tool-compatible csv file, so that it can be fed into BI tools like Tableau and PowerBI for analysis.

The script currently supports Turkish, but can easily be modified for other language strings.

## Usage

Simply download the excel reports for all of your accounts and gather them under a folder. Point the folder to the script:

```
python dre.py folderpath
```

## ETL Operations

Currently, the ETL jobs are:

- Omitting first 3 rows of each account file
- Omitting seperator rows
- Adding account names as a column
- Taking absolute values of AMOUNT field cells
- Deleting the TOTAL column
- Deleting unnecessary categories such as TRANSFER, PAYMENT
- Converting dates
